!  ABSTRACT as 1, the routine itself (SA), with its supplementary
!  routines, is on lines 232-990. A multimodal example from Judge et al.
!  (FCN) is on lines 150-231. The rest of this file (lines 1-149) is a
!  driver routine with values appropriate for the Judge example.  Thus, this
!  example is ready to run.

!  To understand the algorithm, the documentation for SA on lines 236-
!  484 should be read along with the parts of the paper that describe
!  simulated annealing. Then the following lines will then aid the user
!  in becomming proficient with this implementation of simulated annealing.

!  Learning to use SA:
!      Use the sample function from Judge with the following suggestions
!  to get a feel for how SA works. When you've done this, you should be
!  ready to use it on most any function with a fair amount of expertise.
!    1. Run the program as is to make sure it runs okay. Take a look at
!       the intermediate output and see how it optimizes as temperature
!       (T) falls.  Notice how the optimal point is reached and how
!       falling T reduces VM.
!    2. Look through the documentation to SA so the following makes a
!       bit of sense. In line with the paper, it shouldn't be that hard
!       to figure out. The core of the algorithm is described on pp. 68-70
!       and on pp. 94-95. Also see Corana et al. pp. 264-9.
!    3. To see how it selects points and makes decisions about uphill and
!       downhill moves, set IPRINT = 3 (very detailed intermediate output)
!       and MAXEVL = 100 (only 100 function evaluations to limit output).
!    4. To see the importance of different temperatures, try starting
!       with a very low one (say T = 10E-5).  You'll see (i) it never
!       escapes from the local optima (in annealing terminology, it
!       quenches) & (ii) the step length (VM) will be quite small.  This
!       is a key part of the algorithm: as temperature (T) falls, step
!       length does too. In a minor point here, note how VM is quickly
!       reset from its initial value. Thus, the input VM is not very
!       important.  This is all the more reason to examine VM once the
!       algorithm is underway.
!    5. To see the effect of different parameters and their effect on
!       the speed of the algorithm, try RT = .95 & RT = .1.  Notice the
!       vastly different speed for optimization. Also try NT = 20.  Note
!       that this sample function is quite easy to optimize, so it will
!       tolerate big changes in these parameters.  RT and NT are the
!       parameters one should adjust to modify the runtime of the
!       algorithm and its robustness.
!    6. Try constraining the algorithm with either LB or UB.

! ABSTRACT:
!   Simulated annealing is a global optimization method that distinguishes
!   between different local optima.  Starting from an initial point, the
!   algorithm takes a step and the function is evaluated. When minimizing a
!   function, any downhill step is accepted and the process repeats from this
!   new point. An uphill step may be accepted. Thus, it can escape from local
!   optima. This uphill decision is made by the Metropolis criteria. As the
!   optimization process proceeds, the length of the steps decline and the
!   algorithm closes in on the global optimum. Since the algorithm makes very
!   few assumptions regarding the function to be optimized, it is quite
!   robust with respect to non-quadratic surfaces. The degree of robustness
!   can be adjusted by the user. In fact, simulated annealing can be used as
!   a local optimizer for difficult functions.

!   This implementation of simulated annealing was used in "Global Optimizatio
!   of Statistical Functions with Simulated Annealing," Goffe, Ferrier and
!   Rogers, Journal of Econometrics, vol. 60, no. 1/2, Jan./Feb. 1994, pp.
!   65-100. Briefly, we found it competitive, if not superior, to multiple
!   restarts of conventional optimization routines for difficult optimization
!   problems.

!  Version: 3.2
!  Date: 1/22/94.
!  Differences compared to Version 2.0:
!     1. If a trial is out of bounds, a point is randomly selected
!        from LB(i) to UB(i). Unlike in version 2.0, this trial is
!        evaluated and is counted in acceptances and rejections.
!        All corresponding documentation was changed as well.
!  Differences compared to Version 3.0:
!     1. If VM(i) > (UB(i) - LB(i)), VM is set to UB(i) - LB(i).
!        The idea is that if T is high relative to LB & UB, most
!        points will be accepted, causing VM to rise. But, in this
!        situation, VM has little meaning; particularly if VM is
!        larger than the acceptable region. Setting VM to this size
!        still allows all parts of the allowable region to be selected.

!  Synopsis:
!  This routine implements the continuous simulated annealing global
!  optimization algorithm described in Corana et al.'s article "Minimizing
!  Multimodal Functions of Continuous Variables with the "Simulated Annealing"
!  Algorithm" in the September 1987 (vol. 13, no. 3, pp. 262-280) issue of
!  the ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software.

!  A very quick (perhaps too quick) overview of SA:
!     SA tries to find the global optimum of an N dimensional function.
!  It moves both up and downhill and as the optimization process
!  proceeds, it FAMUSes on the most promising area.
!     To start, it randomly chooses a trial point within the step length
!  VM (a vector of length N) of the user selected starting point. The
!  function is evaluated at this trial point and its value is compared
!  to its value at the initial point.
!     In a maximization problem, all uphill moves are accepted and the
!  algorithm continues from that trial point. Downhill moves may be
!  accepted; the decision is made by the Metropolis criteria. It uses T
!  (temperature) and the size of the downhill move in a probabilistic
!  manner. The smaller T and the size of the downhill move are, the more
!  likely that move will be accepted. If the trial is accepted, the
!  algorithm moves on from that point. If it is rejected, another point
!  is chosen instead for a trial evaluation.
!     Each element of VM periodically adjusted so that half of all
!  function evaluations in that direction are accepted.
!     A fall in T is imposed upon the system with the RT variable by
!  T(i+1) = RT*T(i) where i is the ith iteration. Thus, as T declines,
!  downhill moves are less likely to be accepted and the percentage of
!  rejections rise. Given the scheme for the selection for VM, VM falls.
!  Thus, as T declines, VM falls and SA FAMUSes upon the most promising
!  area for optimization.

!  The importance of the parameter T:
!     The parameter T is crucial in using SA successfully. It influences
!  VM, the step length over which the algorithm searches for optima. For
!  a small intial T, the step length may be too small; thus not enough
!  of the function might be evaluated to find the global optima. The user
!  should carefully examine VM in the intermediate output (set IPRINT =
!  1) to make sure that VM is appropriate. The relationship between the
!  initial temperature and the resulting step length is function
!  dependent.
!     To determine the starting temperature that is consistent with
!  optimizing a function, it is worthwhile to run a trial run first. Set
!  RT = 1.5 and T = 1.0. With RT > 1.0, the temperature increases and VM
!  rises as well. Then select the T that produces a large enough VM.

!  For modifications to the algorithm and many details on its use,
!  (particularly for econometric applications) see Goffe, Ferrier
!  and Rogers, "Global Optimization of Statistical Functions with
!  Simulated Annealing," Journal of Econometrics, vol. 60, no. 1/2,

!  As far as possible, the parameters here have the same name as in
!  the description of the algorithm on pp. 266-8 of Corana et al.

!  In this description, SP is single precision, DP is double precision,
!  INT is integer, L is logical and (N) denotes an array of length n.
!  Thus, DP(N) denotes a double precision array of length n.

!  Input Parameters:
!    Note: The suggested values generally come from Corana et al. To
!          drastically reduce runtime, see Goffe et al., pp. 90-1 for
!          suggestions on choosing the appropriate RT and NT.
!    N - Number of variables in the function to be optimized. (INT)
!    X - The starting values for the variables of the function to be
!        optimized. (DP(N))
!    MAX - Denotes whether the function should be maximized or minimized.
!          A true value denotes maximization while a false value denotes
!          minimization.  Intermediate output (see IPRINT) takes this into
!          account. (L)
!    RT - The temperature reduction factor.  The value suggested by
!         Corana et al. is .85. See Goffe et al. for more advice. (DP)
!    EPS - Error tolerance for termination. If the final function
!          values from the last neps temperatures differ from the
!          corresponding value at the current temperature by less than
!          EPS and the final function value at the current temperature
!          differs from the current optimal function value by less than
!          EPS, execution terminates and IER = 0 is returned. (EP)
!    NS - Number of cycles.  After NS*N function evaluations, each element of
!         VM is adjusted so that approximately half of all function evaluations
!         are accepted.  The suggested value is 20. (INT)
!    NT - Number of iterations before temperature reduction. After
!         NT*NS*N function evaluations, temperature (T) is changed
!         by the factor RT.  Value suggested by Corana et al. is
!         MAX(100, 5*N).  See Goffe et al. for further advice. (INT)
!    NEPS - Number of final function values used to decide upon termi-
!           nation.  See EPS.  Suggested value is 4. (INT)
!    MAXEVL - The maximum number of function evaluations.  If it is
!             exceeded, IER = 1. (INT)
!    LB - The lower bound for the allowable solution variables. (DP(N))
!    UB - The upper bound for the allowable solution variables. (DP(N))
!         If the algorithm chooses X(I) .LT. LB(I) or X(I) .GT. UB(I),
!         I = 1, N, a point is from inside is randomly selected. This
!         This FAMUSes the algorithm on the region inside UB and LB.
!         Unless the user wishes to concentrate the search to a particular
!         region, UB and LB should be set to very large positive
!         and negative values, respectively.  Note that the starting
!         vector X should be inside this region.  Also note that LB and
!         UB are fixed in position, while VM is centered on the last
!         accepted trial set of variables that optimizes the function.
!    C - Vector that controls the step length adjustment.  The suggested
!        value for all elements is 2.0. (DP(N))
!    IPRINT - controls printing inside SA. (INT)
!             Values: 0 - Nothing printed.
!                     1 - Function value for the starting value and
!                         summary results before each temperature
!                         reduction. This includes the optimal
!                         function value found so far, the total
!                         number of moves (broken up into uphill,
!                         downhill, accepted and rejected), the
!                         number of out of bounds trials, the
!                         number of new optima found at this
!                         temperature, the current optimal X and
!                         the step length VM. Note that there are
!                         N*NS*NT function evalutations before each
!                         temperature reduction. Finally, notice is
!                         is also given upon achieveing the termination
!                         criteria.
!                     2 - Each new step length (VM), the current optimal
!                         X (XOPT) and the current trial X (X). This
!                         gives the user some idea about how far X
!                         strays from XOPT as well as how VM is adapting
!                         to the function.
!                     3 - Each function evaluation, its acceptance or
!                         rejection and new optima. For many problems,
!                         this option will likely require a small tree
!                         if hard copy is used. This option is best
!                         used to learn about the algorithm. A small
!                         value for MAXEVL is thus recommended when
!                         using IPRINT = 3.
!             Suggested value: 1
!             Note: For a given value of IPRINT, the lower valued
!                   options (other than 0) are utilized.
!    ISEED1 - The first seed for the random number generator RANMAR.
!             0 <= ISEED1 <= 31328. (INT)
!    ISEED2 - The second seed for the random number generator RANMAR.
!             0 <= ISEED2 <= 30081. Different values for ISEED1
!             and ISEED2 will lead to an entirely different sequence
!             of trial points and decisions on downhill moves (when
!             maximizing).  See Goffe et al. on how this can be used
!             to test the results of SA. (INT)

!  Input/Output Parameters:
!    T - On input, the initial temperature. See Goffe et al. for advice.
!        On output, the final temperature. (DP)
!    VM - The step length vector. On input it should encompass the region of
!         interest given the starting value X.  For point X(I), the next
!         trial point is selected is from X(I) - VM(I)  to  X(I) + VM(I).
!         Since VM is adjusted so that about half of all points are accepted,
!         the input value is not very important (i.e. is the value is off,
!         SA adjusts VM to the correct value). (DP(N))

!  Output Parameters:
!    XOPT - The variables that optimize the function. (DP(N))
!    FOPT - The optimal value of the function. (DP)
!    NACC - The number of accepted function evaluations. (INT)
!    NFCNEV - The total number of function evaluations. In a minor
!             point, note that the first evaluation is not used in the
!             core of the algorithm; it simply initializes the
!             algorithm. (INT).
!    NOBDS - The total number of trial function evaluations that
!            would have been out of bounds of LB and UB. Note that
!            a trial point is randomly selected between LB and UB. (INT)
!    IER - The error return number. (INT)
!          Values: 0 - Normal return; termination criteria achieved.
!                  1 - Number of function evaluations (NFCNEV) is
!                      greater than the maximum number (MAXEVL).
!                  2 - The starting value (X) is not inside the
!                      bounds (LB and UB).
!                  3 - The initial temperature is not positive.
!                  99 - Should not be seen; only used internally.

!  Work arrays that must be dimensioned in the calling routine:
!       RWK1 (DP(NEPS))  (FSTAR in SA)
!       RWK2 (DP(N))     (XP    "  " )
!       IWK  (INT(N))    (NACP  "  " )
!  N.B. In the Fortran 90 version, these are automatic arrays.

!  Required Functions (included):
!    EXPREP - Replaces the function EXP to avoid under- and overflows.
!             It may have to be modified for non IBM-type main-
!             frames. (DP)
!    RMARIN - Initializes the random number generator RANMAR.
!    RANMAR - The actual random number generator. Note that
!             RMARIN must run first (SA does this). It produces uniform
!             random numbers on [0,1]. These routines are from
!             Usenet's comp.lang.fortran. For a reference, see
!             "Toward a Universal Random Number Generator"
!             by George Marsaglia and Arif Zaman, Florida State
!             University Report: FSU-SCRI-87-50 (1987).
!             It was later modified by F. James and published in
!             "A Review of Pseudo-random Number Generators." For
!             further information, contact stuart@ads.com. These
!             routines are designed to be portable on any machine
!             with a 24-bit or more mantissa. I have found it produces
!             identical results on a IBM 3081 and a Cray Y-MP.

!  Required Subroutines (included):
!    PRTVEC - Prints vectors.
!    PRT1 ... PRT10 - Prints intermediate output.
!    FCN - Function to be optimized. The form is
